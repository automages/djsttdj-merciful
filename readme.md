# DJ SABRINA THE TEENAGE DJ'S INCANTATION OF INFINITE MERCY
A readme file? For Magick?

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEPLOYING THE INCANTATION (ON "WINDOWS")
1. Copy the djsttdj-merciful.js skript (https://github.com/automages/djsttdj-merciful/blob/master/djsttdj-merciful.js)
2. Open up https://twitter.com/settings/blocked/all in a chrome browser tab.
3. Hit F12! This will open the Chrome Inspector. 
4. Hit the console tab; there's usually one visible on the top menu line (Elements > Console > Sources > etc) 
5. Paste the skript into the dialog box at the bottom (the last > symbol) and hit Enter!

Now the skript is janky and currently doesn't work as intended; (infinite scroll is no fun to work around). It will scan your entire blocklist and print the total number of blocked users, and the number of repentant muskman enablers. 
It will then attempt to unblock the repentant, but it gets confused and will only unblock those loaded on the last scroll. This will be fixed eventually! But for the time being, you'll need to run the skript repeatedly to save -all- the sinners. 🙏
